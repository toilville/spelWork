   - Vision for a more integrated, human-centered approach

2. **Framework Walk-Through** (45 minutes)
   - Core concepts and structure
   - Technical implementation approach
   - Human expertise integration
   - Trust, ethics, and data management components

3. **Interactive Exploration** (30 minutes)
   - Small group discussions applying framework to real organizational processes
   - Identification of potential implementation challenges
   - Highlighting specific benefits for different stakeholder groups

4. **Feedback Collection** (30 minutes)
   - Guided questions about framework components
   - Discussion of implementation considerations
   - Prioritization of development areas

**Key Discussion Questions**:

- How does this framework compare to your current approaches to process evaluation?
- Which components seem most valuable for your specific organizational context?
- What concerns do you have about implementing this type of framework?
- Where do you see the greatest potential for improving current processes?
- What would make this framework more accessible to different stakeholders?
- How might this approach help address specific challenges you're facing?

### Implementation Planning Session

**Purpose**: Develop concrete plans for piloting the Spelwork framework in specific organizational contexts

**Format**: Half-day workshop with potential implementation teams

**Agenda**:

1. **Process Selection** (60 minutes)
   - Criteria for selecting appropriate pilot processes
   - Evaluation of candidate processes
   - Selection and scoping of initial implementation

2. **Resource Planning** (45 minutes)
   - Identifying required technical and human resources
   - Developing implementation timeline
   - Assigning roles and responsibilities

3. **Success Metrics** (45 minutes)
   - Defining what success looks like
   - Establishing measurement approach
   - Setting baseline and target metrics

4. **Risk Management** (45 minutes)
   - Identifying potential challenges and barriers
   - Developing mitigation strategies
   - Creating contingency plans

5. **Next Steps and Action Planning** (45 minutes)
   - Documenting specific next actions
   - Establishing communication and governance approach
   - Setting review points and decision gates

**Key Planning Considerations**:

- Start with a process that has clear pain points but isn't mission-critical
- Ensure executive sponsorship and stakeholder buy-in
- Allocate dedicated resources rather than adding to existing workloads
- Create psychological safety for trying new approaches
- Develop clear communication plans for all affected stakeholders
- Establish regular review points to assess progress and make adjustments

### Feedback Integration Session

**Purpose**: Systematically incorporate learnings from pilot implementations to refine the framework

**Format**: Structured retrospective with implementation teams and framework developers

**Agenda**:

1. **Implementation Experience Review** (60 minutes)
   - What went well? What was challenging?
   - What was missing from the framework?
   - Which components provided the most value?
   - Where did reality differ from expectations?

2. **Framework Enhancement Identification** (60 minutes)
   - Specific areas for improvement
   - New components or tools needed
   - Documentation and training gaps
   - Integration challenges to address

3. **Prioritization and Planning** (60 minutes)
   - Impact vs. effort assessment of potential improvements
   - Development roadmap updates
   - Resource allocation for enhancement work
   - Timeline and milestone setting

**Key Reflection Questions**:

- How well did the framework accommodate the complexities of real processes?
- Were stakeholders able to understand and engage with the framework concepts?
- What unexpected benefits or challenges emerged during implementation?
- How did the framework perform compared to existing approaches?
- What cultural or organizational factors affected implementation success?
- What would make adoption easier for future implementations?
