# Spelwork: A Systemic Process Evaluation Lattice Framework

## Core Concept
Spelwork is an open-source framework for evaluating organizational processes through a lattice structure that maps interconnections, flows, and outcomes. The framework approaches process design and evaluation as intentional acts of manifestation within systems, focusing on how clearly defined wishes translate into organizational reality.

## The Spelwork Approach

### 1. Wish Definition (Process Foundation)
At the foundation of Spelwork is clear wish definition. Organizations must articulate the precise wishes behind each process:

- **Wish Clarity**: Explicit statements of desired outcomes
- **Wish Coherence**: Ensuring wishes are free from contradictions
- **Wish Alignment**: Connecting process wishes with broader organizational values
- **Wish Documentation**: Recording wishes in systematic, accessible formats
- **Expert-Guided Definition**: Facilitated workshops led by process experts to articulate wishes
- **Knowledge Elicitation**: Techniques to capture tacit expertise from experienced practitioners
- **Cross-Functional Reviews**: Ensuring wishes reflect diverse perspectives and expertise

### 2. Boundary Setting (System Context)
Every process exists within defined boundaries that must be established:

- **Domain Mapping**: Defining where processes begin and end
- **Boundary Controls**: Identifying mechanisms that maintain process integrity
- **Context Dimensions**: Acknowledging the key dimensions of process contexts (people, resources, time, information)
- **Transition Points**: Recognizing handoffs between processes and systems
- **Experience-Based Boundaries**: Using expert interviews and shadowing to identify natural process boundaries based on practical experience
- **Human-Centered Mapping**: Facilitating sessions with experienced practitioners to identify contextual factors

### 3. Resource Alignment (Elements of Success)
Processes require specific resources to manifest wishes:

- **Physical Resources**: Tangible assets and infrastructure required
- **Information Resources**: Data, communication, and intellectual components
- **Transformative Elements**: Change mechanisms and catalysts
- **Relational Components**: Team dynamics and adaptability factors
- **Purpose Elements**: Meaning and alignment with organizational vision

### 4. Flow Optimization (Process Activation)
How resources and effort flow through processes:

- **Flow Channels**: Pathways through which work moves across the lattice
- **Critical Nodes**: Key junctures where activity concentrates or transforms
- **Flow Quality**: Measuring the clarity and focus of efforts
- **Pattern Recognition**: How momentum builds or dissipates across iterations

### 5. Outcome Realization (Results Evaluation)
Assessing how wishes materialize into results:

- **Intended Outcomes**: Direct fulfillment of stated wishes
- **Unintended Outcomes**: Side effects and unexpected results
- **Systemic Feedback**: How process outcomes cycle back to affect the system
- **Intention-Reality Gap**: Measuring the distance between intention and actual results

## Technical Implementation

## Implementation Approach
The open-source Spelwork framework would include:

1. Core data models and schemas for the process lattice
2. Visualization libraries for different views of the system
3. Evaluation methodologies and metrics calculation tools
